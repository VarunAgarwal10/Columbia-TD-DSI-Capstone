Weekly Progress Check-In Instructions:
Please complete the following questions about your project progress. Keep your response concise, sticking to 1-2 sentences per question. Address each of the points below:

Last week's mentor meeting was really insightful, met and discussed few concepts with co-mentor too, Urvi. Got a good clarity and sense of direction.

Yes, we do on a higher level. There are a few questions we need to ask to our mentor (Data -related question) to get her industry opinion.

Yes, after EDA. We have 2 step approach. First, we are going to be working on feature engineering, as it's crucial for our task, to identify important features. Second, going to start building baseline models.
