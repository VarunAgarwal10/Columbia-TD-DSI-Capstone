Weekly Progress Check-In Instructions:
Please complete the following questions about your project progress. Keep your response concise, sticking to 1-2 sentences per question. Address each of the points below:
1. How was the mentor meeting? Was there a good discussion/Did you get your questions answered/requests responded to?
   It was a good meeting, we met with Urvi (Raveena was on leave).
   We shared with her our coding on the GTL-Llama modeling applied to our dataset. We tried different things (varied num features, sample size,...).
   Some feedback got from last meeting included: ignoring the use of the accuracy metric (due to the unbalanced dataset), and instead focus more on F1 and AUC.
   Ryu presented the findings in our last weekly meeting.

2. What has been your individual contribution to the project this week?
   I got the models running on my machine for the dataset (for downloading and using the models, Meta's and HF approvals were obtained), and I am currently trying different prompt implementations to try to increase the overall performance of the models.

3: What has been the group’s overall status and contributions this week?
   The group is working on applying the GTLs models to our data. Particularly, we have been working on the T-table prompt approach from the 'From Supervised to Generative' Paper, and trying different implementations to increase the overall performance.

4. Any challenges or roadblocks?
   Not major challenges. So far we have been working on the T-table approach, once finished we'd like to also try the T-anony and T-lang approaches. 

5. Any questions or feedback? 
   No additional questions/feedback
