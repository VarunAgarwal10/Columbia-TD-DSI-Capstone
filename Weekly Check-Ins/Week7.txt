Weekly Progress Check-In Instructions:
Please complete the following questions about your project progress. Keep your response concise, sticking to 1-2 sentences per question. Address each of the points below:
1. How was the mentor meeting? Was there a good discussion/Did you get your questions answered/requests responded to?
Went well. We presented our work done over the past week: performing more runs per hyperparam setting for our experiments (for more stable results/std), T-anony. TD mentors Urvi and Raveena loved our presentation. It was clear and concise
2. Do you have clear next steps?
We plan to run experiments in parallel across all group members, using also the 13B-GTL model (was using 7B-GTL), for more runs per hyperparam setting. We have requested for more GCP credits for this, since Colab Pro would not cut it.
3. Do you and your teammates know exactly what you'll be doing this week?
We plan to each run the same code but using different hyperparams. I plan to try training a Foundational Model using Microsoft paper's open-sourced code
4. Any challenges or roadblocks?
We face a human resource challenge within the group. We have tried to fix it, but with little to no improvement. I will share more
5. Any questions or feedback? 
hope TAs can accelerate the provision of the GCP credits
